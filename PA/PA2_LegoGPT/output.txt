Welcome to PA2, basic tests for Module
Module name = basic filter, this is a filter, filter type = reserved
Module name = basic handler, this is a Handler, can handle topic = naiveHandler
Module name = basic filterHandler, this is a filterHandler, filter type = reserved, handler topic = naiveFilterHandler

Module name = basic filter, this is a filter, filter type = reserved
There is(are) 2 handler(s) in the LegoGPT
They are:
naiveHandler
naiveFilterHandler
There is(are) 2 filter(s) in the LegoGPT
Module name = basic filter, this is a filter, filter type = reserved
Module name = basic filterHandler, this is a filterHandler, filter type = reserved, handler topic = naiveFilterHandler
Let's train simple handlers!
Question is: How are you? answer: Fine, thank you, and you?

Let's get a humorous math answer.
I don't know what is 3 + 5, but I know 3 + 5 = 5 + 3. Because Integers under Addition form an Abelian Group.
Let's ask a math question in Martian.
Before training:
Sorry, I don't know
After training:
